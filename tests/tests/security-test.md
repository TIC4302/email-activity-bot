## Code Review & Application Platform Scanning

#### OWASP ZAP Test 
A Pentest was conducted using Django's Framework against the webform thats being openly faced by customers. This webform would be the point of contact between the users and the Email Bot itself. 
The pentest was conducted using OWASP ZAP which is an open-source web application security scanner.

* The initial Test using OWASP ZAP pentest was run on Django as shown in the image below. Based on the test, it was evident that the X-XSS HTTP headers were not enabled, thus allowing room for XSS to take place.

* The timestamp lifespan of the cookie was disclosed and visible within the header text based on the results of the test.

* The test confirmed that there were no HttpOnly flag set, which would allow for possible malice access via javascript.

#### Nikto Test 
Additional to the pentest conducted using OWASP ZAP, another scan using Nikto was run against Django. The results from Nikto further verifies the lack of HttpOnly flag along with multiple other vulnerabilities pertaining to XSS.

#### Bandit Scan 
To perform a deeper analysis within the functions of the Email Bot, the Bandit Tool was used. Bandit is an automated tool design to find common security issues in python codes. The Bandit tool was run against the functionalities within the various main python codes.

* Bandit was first run against the file filter_and_formatting_for_cosine.py, which contains the algorithm that assists in analysing the email to provide the appropriate responses to the customers. Based on the analysis, there were a total of 109 lines of code with 0 issues found.

* Bandit was also run on the main file, read_parse.py, that ties in the overall design of the email bot. Based on the analysis, there were a total of 88 lines of code with 0 issues found.

* Bandit was also run against the Django framework itself. In this case, there were mainly 2 issues that were identified by Bandit. 1st being a severity low was in relevance to an out of the box key that was generated by Django during the initial setup of the Django directories. The 2nd identified issue was in relevance to a poorly hardcoded password within the code pertaining to the login details of the email account of the application. The 2nd issue was categorised as a medium level in severity.
